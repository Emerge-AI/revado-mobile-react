--upload-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
--success-green: #10B981;
--calming-blue: #60A5FA;
--anxiety-reduce: #F3F4F6;
```

### Animation Specifications
```css
/* Breathing animation */
@keyframes breathe {
  0%, 100% { transform: scale(1); opacity: 0.8; }
  50% { transform: scale(1.05); opacity: 1; }
}

  0% { transform: scale(0); }
  50% { transform: scale(1.1); }
  100% { transform: scale(1); }
}
```

## üìù Technical Requirements

### API Endpoints Needed
```javascript
POST /api/upload/analyze - AI categorization
POST /api/upload/batch - Multiple file upload
GET /api/upload/suggestions - Context-aware hints
POST /api/upload/family - Family member tagging
```

### State Management Updates
```javascript
// UploadContext additions
- uploadQueue: []
- currentUpload: {}
- suggestions: []
- familyMembers: []
- batchMode: false
```

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load bottom sheet component
