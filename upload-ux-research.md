# Upload UX Research & Design Documentation

## Executive Summary
This document contains comprehensive UX research and design recommendations for improving the upload flow in the Revado mobile health records app. The research includes user personas, emotional journey mapping, and specific design interventions to create a more intuitive and emotionally supportive upload experience.

## Current Upload Flow Analysis

### Existing Implementation
The current upload flow consists of:
1. **Navigation**: Upload button in bottom TabBar ‚Üí Navigate to `/upload` page
2. **Method Selection**: Four upload options presented as cards:
   - Upload PDF/Image (file selection)
   - Take Photo (camera capture)
   - Connect Provider (email-based)
   - Talk to AI Assistant (voice recording)
3. **Processing**: Upload progress with percentage indicator
4. **Confirmation**: Success message with green checkmark

### Identified Pain Points
