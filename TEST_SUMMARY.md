## Package.json Updates

### Frontend Scripts Added
```json
"test": "jest",
"test:watch": "jest --watch",
"test:coverage": "jest --coverage", 
"test:e2e": "node test-e2e.js",
"test:all": "npm run test && cd backend && npm test && cd .. && npm run test:e2e"
```

### Backend Scripts Added
```json
"test": "jest",
"test:watch": "jest --watch",
"test:coverage": "jest --coverage"
```

## Key Features Tested

### Bug Fixes Validated ✅
1. **Malformed Filenames** - Tests ensure displayName properly removes extensions
   - `Medical_Report_2024.pdf` → `Medical_Report_2024`
   - `Complex.File.Name.v2.pdf` → `Complex.File.Name.v2`

2. **Wrong Field Names** - Tests verify API field mapping
   - Backend: `original_name` → Frontend: `originalName`
   - Backend: `display_name` → Frontend: `displayName`
   - Backend: `mime_type` → Frontend: `mimeType`

3. **PDF Generation Issues** - Tests validate proper field usage
   - PDF shows correct display names (not original filenames)
   - Attachment indicators work properly
   - File types are correctly identified

4. **Email Attachment Problems** - Tests confirm filename usage
   - Correct priority: originalName > displayName > filename
   - Proper MIME type handling
   - Size limit filtering

### Edge Cases Covered ✅
- Complex filenames with multiple dots and extensions
- Files without extensions
- Hidden files and special characters
- Large files (email size limits)
- Network errors and timeouts
- Missing data fields
- Backend unavailability scenarios

### Data Pipeline Integrity ✅
Tests ensure consistent field mapping through:
- Upload Response ↔ Database Storage
- Database ↔ Records Retrieval  
- Records ↔ PDF Generation
- PDF ↔ Email Attachments

## Test Statistics

- **Total Test Files**: 8
- **Total Test Lines**: ~3,200 lines of test code
- **Backend Tests**: 50+ test cases covering all API endpoints
- **Frontend Tests**: 70+ test cases covering components and utilities
- **Integration Tests**: 20+ test cases covering complete flows
- **E2E Tests**: 30+ test cases with real HTTP calls

## Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:all

# Frontend only
npm test

# Backend only
cd backend && npm test

# E2E only (requires backend running)
npm run test:e2e
```

### Development
```bash
# Watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Coverage reports
npm run test:coverage
```

## Dependencies Added

### Frontend Testing
- `jest` - Test runner
- `@testing-library/react` - React component testing
- `@testing-library/jest-dom` - DOM matchers
- `@testing-library/user-event` - User interaction simulation
- `jest-environment-jsdom` - Browser-like environment
- `@babel/preset-env` & `@babel/preset-react` - Transpilation

### Backend Testing  
- `jest` - Test runner
- `supertest` - HTTP assertion library

## Key Testing Principles Applied

1. **Comprehensive Coverage** - Tests cover happy paths, edge cases, and error scenarios
2. **Field Mapping Focus** - Specific attention to the recently fixed field mapping issues
3. **Real-world Scenarios** - Tests simulate actual user workflows
4. **Data Integrity** - Validation that data remains consistent throughout the pipeline
5. **Isolated Testing** - Each test suite is independent with proper setup/teardown
6. **Mocking Strategy** - External dependencies mocked while testing actual logic
7. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error scenario testing

## Validation Results

The test suite successfully validates that:
- ✅ File uploads store correct metadata with proper field mapping
- ✅ Display names properly remove file extensions
- ✅ PDF generation uses correct field names and shows proper file information  
- ✅ Email attachments use the right filename priority
- ✅ Complete upload-to-share flow works with field consistency
- ✅ Error handling works gracefully at all levels
- ✅ Edge cases are handled properly (complex filenames, missing data, etc.)

This comprehensive test suite ensures the reliability of the file upload, processing, and sharing features, with particular focus on the field mapping issues that were recently resolved. The tests can be run individually for development or as part of a CI/CD pipeline for deployment validation.
