# Testing the Complete Flow

## ✅ Backend is Running!

The backend server is now running with proper CORS configuration.

## Testing Options

### Option 1: Use the Backend Test Page (Recommended)
Open this URL in your browser:
```
http://localhost:3001/test/test.html
```

This test page is served directly by the backend, avoiding CORS issues.

### Option 2: Test with the React App
1. Make sure backend is running (it is!)
2. Start the React app:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open: https://localhost:5173
4. Go to Upload page - you'll see "Server Connected" status
5. Upload a photo - it will be stored on the backend
6. Go to Share page - send to dentist with attachments

### Option 3: Direct API Testing with curl

Test health endpoint:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
```

Upload a file:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/upload/single \
  -H "X-User-Id: test-user" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/your/image.jpg" \
  -F "userId=test-user"
```

Get records:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/records \
  -H "X-User-Id: test-user"
```

## What's Working Now

✅ **Backend Server**
- Running on port 3001
- CORS configured for all localhost origins
- File upload endpoints ready
- SQLite database initialized
- Test page available at /test/test.html

✅ **Frontend Integration**
- UploadPage shows backend status indicator
- Files upload to backend when available
- Falls back to localStorage when offline
- Progress tracking for uploads

✅ **Email Attachments**
- PDF summary always generated
- Small files (<500KB) attached to emails
- File list included in email body
- Works with EmailJS or mailto fallback

## Troubleshooting

### "Backend not available" error
This was caused by CORS. Now fixed with:
- Permissive CORS in development mode
- Test page served by backend
- Support for file:// origins

### File upload fails
- Check file size (max 10MB)
- Verify file type (images, PDFs)
- Ensure backend is running

### Email doesn't include attachments
- Only files <500KB are attached (EmailJS limit)
- Larger files noted in PDF but not attached
- Consider using SendGrid for larger attachments

## File Storage Location

Uploaded files are stored in:
```
backend/uploads/
├── images/     # JPG, PNG, GIF files
├── pdfs/       # PDF documents  
└── documents/  # Other document types
```

## Database

SQLite database stores metadata:
```
backend/database/health_records.db
```

View records:
```bash
sqlite3 backend/database/health_records.db "SELECT * FROM records;"
```
