<h3>Summary:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Number of Records: {{record_count}}</li>
  <li>Date Range: {{date_range}}</li>
</ul>

<div style="background: #f5f5f5; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 20px 0;">
  <pre>{{summary}}</pre>
</div>

<p style="color: #666; font-size: 12px;">

  Please handle with appropriate security measures.
</p>

<hr>

<p style="color: #999; font-size: 11px;">

</p>
```

### Step 4: Get Your Public Key

2. Copy your **Public Key**

### Step 5: Configure the App

```

2. Add your EmailJS credentials:
```env
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_your_id_here
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_your_id_here
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here
```

3. Restart the development server:

3. Check EmailJS dashboard for quota/errors
4. Make sure email service is connected properly

### PDF Not Generating?
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Ensure records have been uploaded first
3. Try with fewer records if many are selected
